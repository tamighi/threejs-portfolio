# threejs-portfolio

## Description

This frontend website portfolio is built using React, Three.js, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS.

This project is based on a YouTube tutorial and has been further improved. With the integration of Three.js, I've incorporated stunning 3D designs and animations that bring the content of this website to life. The combination of React's powerful components, Framer Motion's smooth transitions, and Tailwind CSS's flexible styling allows for an engaging and visually appealing user experience.
